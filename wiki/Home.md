**SideQuest** is a hyper-local, real-time marketplace that connects neighbors to help each other with tasks in exchange for rewards (₹). Think of it as IRL side-quests for your neighborhood! 🎮

## 🎯 What is SideQuest?

SideQuest bridges the gap between people who need help with tasks and neighbors who have time to help. It's powered by real-time maps, secure escrow payments, and a user-friendly interface that makes finding and offering help as easy as posting on social media.

**The Simple Formula:**
- **You**: Have money (₹), no time/energy
- **Neighbor**: Has time/energy, wants money (₹)
- **SideQuest**: *Now kith* 🤝
